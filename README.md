# Data Visualisation
___
### Exercice de consolidation en JavaScript
- Projet réalisé seul en juin 2024 au cours de ma formation [WebDev à BeCode](https://becode.org/).
- Objectif : consolider notre apprentissage du JavaScript par le biais d'un exercice, visant à implémenter de la datavisualisation dans un article en ligne. 
The evaluation method chosen is a self-evaluation based on the following indicators:

1. handling of the DOM:
 - [x] I was able to find the right selector to do it.
 - [x] I was able to inject the graph in the right place on the page via javascript.
 - [x] I was able to retrieve the html data in a format adapted to my javascript code.
2. Request ajax/fetch:
 - [x] I was able to receive the answer from the remote server in json.
 - [x] Then, I was able to build a callback function to process this data.
3. Use of third party libraries:
 - [x] I was able to integrate the third-party library into my application.
 - [x] I used the documentation provided by the library.
 - [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
 - [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.
4. Problem-solving:
 - [x] Syntactic rigor: I was able to translate the processes I imagined into javascript syntax.

Logical thinking: Through iterations and trial and error, I was able to find a logical path that works to address the issues raised by the client's request. Specifically:
 - [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
 - [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.
 - [x] I was able to build a callback function to process remote data (received via ajax).
 - [ ] I was able to make the realtime graph refresh in real time.
 - [x] I was able to display the detailed data when I hover the mouse.
5. Debugging:
 - [x] I use the console to understand what is happening and compare what I am trying to program with what the machine is doing.
6. Separation of concerns:
 - [x] If I disable javascript, the user experience is satisfactory, the user has access to data and content
 - [x] If I enable javascript, the tables are enhanced with an interactive graph.
